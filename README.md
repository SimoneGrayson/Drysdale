The Drysdale â€“ Adirondack Chair Plans
Welcome to The Drysdale, a lazy-day loverâ€™s dream in chair form. These are free, open-source plans for building your own Adirondack-style chair, designed and illustrated by @pixypond.

Whether you're a seasoned woodworker or trying your hand at your first DIY project, these patterns provide everything you need to build a comfy, classic outdoor chair.

ðŸ”¨ What's Included
Full-scale printable templates for every part of the chair and many images of how I built them.

ðŸª‘ Photo Gallery
Photos of completed Drysdale chairs can be found in the build-images folder. They're great for inspiration!

Notes: Optional extended armrests are included but not required. I found stainless steel Torx deck screws to be the strongest and easiest to work with. Some Robertson (square driver) screws broke in the wood, and philips head scews for general wood working would strip easily. Torx screws are very reliable.
