These images are just here to help guide the process. They’re not a strict step-by-step—more like friendly pointers to give you an idea of how it all comes together. Feel free to do things your own way!

If you are planning on making a chair that will last outside in the elements for many years, I suggest using a hardwood for the construction. Softwood, such as Pine is a much cheaper alternative and a good option if your chairs are going to protect from the weather, painted and regularly maintained. 
The plans are designed for 19mm Merbau, Spotted Gum and 22mm Silver Ash. If you are building with wood that is a different width, make sure to adjust your screw hole positions, for example, if you are screwing the seat slats down onto 19 mm Merbau, the screw holes need to be 9.5mm in from the edge, whereas 22mm Silver Ash needs to be 11mm from the edge.  
I brought three 5.7 meter lengths of 140mm x 19mm decking and had them cut down to 1.9 meters, as that was the only way they would fit into the back of my car. And it also made them much more manageable back in the shop. For the screws, I decided on bronze timber screws to build the Streeton, as the bronze colour worked well with the Merbau and stainless steel decking screws for the Drysdale.
The Templates
If you're not into math and like things worked out for you, the Precut Stencils, are just what you need. They make building either the Drysdale “easier” but it still takes a considerable amount of effort. Just grab a stencil, lay it over the wood, trace it out and you're ready to cut.
The PDF plans can be printed out, either at scale if you have access to a large format printer or tiled and taped together and then cut them out with a sharp box cutter. (If you don't own a printer, your local office supply store or local printer will be able to print them out for you for a small fee.)
The grid pattern on the templates are set at 25 mm units that have smaller 5 mm units inside. They are handy as an aide to help line up the sheets when taping them together. You can also use them to quickly measure distances just by glancing at them and counting the grids.

Making something that lasts with your own hands that, looks great, is comfortable, functional, and didn't come from a store is a truly satisfying feeling.
